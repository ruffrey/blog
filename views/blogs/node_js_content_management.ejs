<p>The Node community offers nearly as many frameworks as there are developers. The knowledge/content/blog management space seems to be growing rapidly now, too.</p>
<h2>MONGO-BASED</h2>
<h3><a href="http://calip.so" title="calipso web cms" target="_blank">Calipso</a></h3>
<p>While lightweight (what isn't in Node.js compared to other technologies?)&nbsp;<a href="http://calip.so/" title="Calipso Node.js CMS" target="_blank">Calipso</a>&nbsp;is probably the most feature rich, aiming to be comparable to Wordpress, Drupal, or Joomla. It has a growing <a href="http://calip.so/repo" title="Calipso module and theme repository" target="_blank">repository</a> of themes and modules. Calipso runs on MongoDB and has a fast graphical setup.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/anddimario/mucontent" title="mucontent on github" target="_blank">MuContent</a></h3>
<p>MC doesn't seem to have a website, but it is on <a href="https://github.com/anddimario/mucontent" title="MuContent github page" target="_blank">github</a> and has a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/mucontent" title="the google group for mu content" target="_blank">very active google group.</a>&nbsp;It's not quite as polished as Calipso, but it's quite fast and uses <a href="http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/" title="connect high quality node.js middleware" target="_blank">connect</a> w/<a href="https://github.com/vdemedes/route66" title="route66 connect routing" target="_blank">route66</a>, with <a href="http://twitter.github.com/hogan.js/" title="hogan.js from twitter - templating in javascript" target="_blank">hogan</a>&nbsp;(from Twitter) for templating.</p>
<h2>NO DATABASE!</h2>
<p>This might sound foreign to those new to Node.js, but most of the CMS &amp; blog platforms actually don't use databases.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/olegp/mcms" title="Github repo for MCMS" target="_blank">MCMS</a> is a super fast CMS with no database to store pages - they live as static files on the server. HTML writers may love the simplicity here. The lack of database operations really make this platform scream. <a href="http://looseleafjs.org/" title="Loose leaf CMS" target="_blank">Looseleaf</a> is another sans-database CMS, though it's based on express.js &amp; JSON.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevry/docpad" title="docpad on github" target="_blank">DocPad</a> kind of has a database and kindof doesn't. It's got a <a href="https://github.com/bevry/docpad/wiki/Showcase" title="DocPad website bragging" target="_blank">long list of production websites</a> running on it already. And it is probably the most flexible when it comes to templating. The core values behind DocPad seem to be rapid development and thorough documentation.</p>

<p>More to come!</p>
